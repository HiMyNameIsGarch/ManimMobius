# A Mobius Transformation Animation using Manim

### Description
This is a simple animation of a Mobius Transformation using the Manim library. The Mobius Transformation is a complex function of the form f(z) = (az + b)/(cz + d) where a, b, c, and d are complex numbers. The animation shows how the Mobius Transformation maps the complex plane to itself.

### Requirements
- Python 3.7
- Manim library

### Usage
To run the animation, simply run the following command in the terminal <br>
```
manim -pqh mobius.py
```

### Output
The output of the animation is a video file named `mobius.mp4` which will be saved in the `media` folder.
If you want to modify the quality of the animation or the resolution of the video, you can change the parameters in the `mobius.py` file.
